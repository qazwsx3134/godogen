"""Map collision and navigation for every map tool: one blocking set, one rule book.

forge_nav is the canonical implementation of plan Appendix C as decided for Phase 3
(integration decisions D1-D7). It was extracted from B13's map_nav.py and map_bundle.py.
Canonical copy: shared/forge_nav.py; byte-identical copies ship in
skills/generate2dmap/scripts and skills/codeart2d/scripts (shared/VENDORED.json). It imports
only the standard library and numpy. merge_rects (D30) and reading a material-map image use
the sibling forge_core.py (API 1.1 or later), imported on first use, and through it Pillow.
There is no scipy path: map_nav never had one.

Consumers (D2, D4): map_nav.py (the CLI and its reports), the compose_layered_preview
actor-feet audit (--bundle), export_godot / export_ldtk / export_tiled (the blocking set),
layout_build (the reachability proof) and build_scene_preview. map-runtime.mjs mirrors the
rules below rule for rule, and layered-map-contract.md quotes them.

API
  read_blocking_set(path) / blocking_set_from_document(doc, base_dir) -> BlockingSet
      The D2 blocking set of one map bundle (v2, or v1 read the way map_bundle.py reads it).
      This reader only gathers what collision needs; map_bundle.py validate stays the gate.
  BlockingSet.model() -> CollisionModel; BlockingSet.solids lists every blocking shape.
  runtime_inputs(blocking) -> {"tileSolids", "materialGrid"}: what map-runtime.mjs cannot read
      from a bundle (it reads no files), in the form createMapRuntime takes as its options.
  CollisionModel(width, height, radius, y_squash, regions, solids, material_codes, material_scale)
      .valid(xs, ys)  .blocked(xs, ys)  .area_ok(xs, ys)  .centre_ok(xs, ys)
      .segment_status(a, b, thin_gap=True) -> None or the reason   .segment_clear(a, b)
      .with_actor(radius, y_squash) -> the same blockers for another actor
  build_grid(model) -> NavGrid (nodes, open moves, thin gaps)
  grid_bfs(passable, starts, moves) / reachable_mask / moves_from_mask: the generic grid BFS
  navigate(model, starts) -> Navigation, with .point_target(p), .reach_target(p, reach) and
      .exit_target(trigger, activation, radius) answering as map_nav.py check does
  Building blocks: footprint_solid, object_solid, has_area (N4), tile_solids, material_codes,
      collision_shapes, merge_rects, nav_cell, footprint_offsets, pnpoly, on_polygon_edge,
      Trigger, attach.

THE RULES
Arithmetic is IEEE-754 double. Every formula is evaluated in the order written (left to
right, with the grouping shown), so a port with the same operation order gets bit-identical
answers. The one exception is the sine and cosine of a rotation, which come from the
platform's libm (CPython calls the C runtime, V8 its own fdlibm port; they can differ by one
ulp, for example at sin(pi / 4)). Points exactly on a rotated edge can then fall on
different sides, so parity fixtures keep rotations at 0 or away from boundaries.

N1  Space. World pixels, x to the right, y down. W = world.width, H = world.height.
    rotate is in degrees, positive = clockwise on screen. theta = rotate * (pi / 180)
    (math.radians), c = cos(theta), s = sin(theta). A rotate of 0 (or none) means c = 1 and
    s = 0 exactly: no trigonometry is evaluated.

N2  Actor. r = collision.actorRadius, rx = r, ry = r * ySquash (ySquash defaults to 1.0;
    HD-2D plates use about 0.58). The 9 samples of a position P are P + o for these offsets,
    in this order: (0, 0), (rx, 0), (dx, dy), (0, ry), (-dx, dy), (-rx, 0), (-dx, -dy),
    (0, -ry), (dx, -dy), with dx = rx * SQRT1_2, dy = ry * SQRT1_2 and
    SQRT1_2 = 0.7071067811865476 (Math.SQRT1_2). A sample is (P.x + o.x, P.y + o.y).

N3  Walk area. Without walk regions it is the closed box 0 <= x <= W and 0 <= y <= H.
    With walk regions a point is in the walk area when some region's polygon contains it
    and none of that same region's holes contains it. Containment is the even-odd crossing
    test (pnpoly): start outside; for i = 0 .. n-1 take a = poly[i] and b = poly[i - 1]
    (i = 0 pairs with the last vertex); skip the edge when a.y == b.y; otherwise toggle when
    ((a.y > y) != (b.y > y)) and x < (b.x - a.x) * (y - a.y) / (b.y - a.y) + a.x. Left and
    top boundaries count as inside and right and bottom boundaries as outside, so regions
    sharing an edge leave no seam; for a hole the same rule means its left and top
    boundaries are not walkable and its right and bottom boundaries are. Membership is
    decided for each sample separately. Regions are never inflated or shrunk.

N4  The blocking set (D2) is identical for every consumer. It is the union of:
      a. collision.solids, in world px;
      b. collision.rects [x, y, w, h], each the closed rect solid (D3: exact blocking
         rectangles, never an approximation of something else);
      c. the footprints of objects whose solid is not false (N6);
      d. the per-tile collision of placed tiles (N7);
      e. the material-map pixels of a blocking class (N8).
    A shape without area blocks nothing and is dropped, wherever it comes from: a rect with
    w <= 0 or h <= 0, an ellipse with rx <= 0 or ry <= 0, a polygon whose shoelace sum
    sum(x[i] * y[i + 1]) - sum(y[i] * x[i + 1]) is exactly 0 (map_bundle.py refuses such a
    polygon outright in collision.solids and in a tileset's tiles[].collision, where it also
    refuses a self-intersecting ring). A point is blocked when it lies in any member. Walk regions
    (N3) bound the walk area; they are not blockers.

N5  Solids are closed sets (D1); a point on a solid's boundary is blocked.
      rect x, y, w, h:   x <= px <= x + w and y <= py <= y + h (x + w, y + h computed first)
      ellipse cx, cy, rx, ry, rotate:  ex = px - cx, ey = py - cy; u = ex, v = ey when the
         rotation is 0, else u = ex * c + ey * s and v = ey * c - ex * s; then
         nu = u / rx, nv = v / ry and the point is blocked when nu * nu + nv * nv <= 1
      polygon points:    the even-odd test of N3, OR the point lies on an edge: for an edge
         a -> b, (b.x - a.x) * (py - a.y) - (b.y - a.y) * (px - a.x) == 0 and
         min(a.x, b.x) <= px <= max(a.x, b.x) and min(a.y, b.y) <= py <= max(a.y, b.y).
         (Exact for axis-aligned edges and vertices; a point on a slanted edge counts when
         that product rounds to zero.)
    Solids are never inflated by the actor size: the samples of N2 add it, once.

N6  Object footprints (D2, D6, D7). An object's footprint and solid come from the object,
    else from its props-registry entry (bundle.props[prop]: an inline item, or the
    accepted prop-pack item named by pack + label, the entry's own fields overriding the
    pack item's). prop_packs, the art lookup of D6 step 3, do not supply footprints. When
    solid is given neither way, the object is solid exactly when its footprint shape is
    ellipse or rect. A solid object with an ellipse or rect footprint blocks this shape:
      k = 1 when footprint.basis is "world_px", else the instance scale (objects[].scale,
         default 1); basis "prop_px" (canonical) and its legacy alias "image_px" are
         measured in prop-image pixels and scaled once (D7); any other basis is an error;
      (ox, oy) = footprint.offset (default [0, 0]); rot = footprint.rotate (default 0);
      flip_x true mirrors the footprint around the anchor x (D6): ox = -ox and rot = -rot;
      cx = x + k * ox, cy = y + k * oy, w = k * width, h = k * depth;
      ellipse:  centre (cx, cy), rx = w / 2, ry = h / 2, rotate rot;
      rect, rot 0:  the rect (cx - w / 2, cy - h / 2, w, h);
      rect, rot != 0:  the polygon of the corners (u, v) = (-w / 2, -h / 2), (w / 2, -h / 2),
         (w / 2, h / 2), (-w / 2, h / 2), each at (cx + u * c - v * s, cy + u * s + v * c).
    Footprints are never inflated by the actor radius.

N7  Tile collision (D5: tileset_v1 tiles[].collision is authoritative). A tiles layer places
    tile index g at grid cell (row, col), whose top-left corner is (col * tw, row * th) for
    the tileset's tile size tw x th; -1 (or null) is an empty cell. A placed tile blocks
    with its collision shapes (tile pixels) moved by that corner: rect x, y, ellipse cx, cy
    and every polygon point shift by (col * tw, row * th). A tile without shapes whose
    properties.walkable is false blocks its whole cell, the rect (0, 0, tw, th). A rect
    whose x, y, w, h are whole numbers with w, h > 0 is clipped to the cell and painted into
    a per-layer pixel mask; the mask is merged into disjoint rects (merge_rects) that cover
    exactly the same closed set. If such a rect reaches outside its cell it is also kept
    whole, as its own solid. Every other shape is kept as its own solid for each placed tile.

N8  Material map. The image covers the world in squares of s = W / image width px; s must
    be a whole number >= 1 with s * image height == H. A point (x, y) reads the pixel
    (floor(x / s), floor(y / s)) when 0 <= floor(x / s) < image width and
    0 <= floor(y / s) < image height; outside the image there is no material. A pixel
    therefore covers [mx * s, (mx + 1) * s) x [my * s, (my + 1) * s): material squares are
    half-open (their right and bottom edges belong to the next pixel), unlike solids.
    Colour images (decoded to 8-bit straight RGBA): a pixel with alpha 0 has no material;
    otherwise its RGB must equal exactly one material's color. A P or L image whose
    materials all have an index matches pixel values to indices. A pixel that matches no
    material refuses the bundle. Classes: solid blocks (even with walkable: true); liquid
    and hazard block unless walkable is true; decor never blocks; one_way never blocks a
    point (N11).

N9  Validity. P is valid when each of its 9 samples (N2) is in the walk area (N3) and not
    blocked (N4).

N10 segmentClear(a, b). dx = b.x - a.x, dy = b.y - a.y, len = sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy),
    n = max(1, ceil(len / (cell / 2))) with the cell of N12. The samples are
    x_k = a.x + dx * k / n and y_k = a.y + dy * k / n for k = 0 .. n (dx * k first, then
    / n, then + a.x; the last sample is therefore not always exactly b). The move is clear
    when every sample is valid (N9), the one_way rule holds (N11) and, unless the caller
    asks for the sampled rule alone, the thin-gap rule holds:
      Thin gaps: the actor's centre must stay in the walk area and off every blocker along
      the whole segment, so a wall or a gap thinner than the sample spacing is never
      jumped. The segment p + t * d (t in [0, 1]) is cut at every t in (0, 1) where it can
      cross a boundary: polygon edges of regions, holes and solids (crossings with
      -1e-12 <= u <= 1 + 1e-12 along the edge, so rounding never drops a vertex from both
      of its edges, and both end points of a collinear overlap), rect sides (the lines
      x = x0, x = x0 + w, y = y0 and y = y0 + h, cut at (x0 - p.x) / dx and so on, wherever
      they cross), both roots of each ellipse's quadratic (disc = b * b - 4 * a * c; when
      |disc| <= 1e-12 * (b * b) the line is tangent and disc is taken as 0, one double
      root), material pixel edges (x = m * s, y = m * s inside the image) and, without walk
      regions, the sides of the world box. The midpoint of every piece longer than 1e-9 px
      ((t1 - t0) * len > 1e-9) must be in the walk area and not blocked. A shorter piece is
      a rounding sliver at a single touching point (the two edges of a vertex, for example,
      cut a segment through that vertex 1 ulp apart) and is skipped: a single touching
      point is not a failure. Cut positions only need to be accurate, not bit-identical:
      each piece's status is constant on its interior.

N11 one_way (D2: blocks from above only; a side-scroll class). A move with b.y > a.y
    (moving down) is blocked when, between consecutive samples k - 1 and k of N10, any of
    the 9 footprint samples goes from a pixel that is not one_way onto a one_way pixel;
    with the thin-gap rule the centre also may not enter one_way along a, the piece
    midpoints of N10 and b. Upward and sideways moves always pass (jump up through a
    platform, stand on it). Bundles carry no view mode, so the rule applies to every map:
    a top-down map should not use one_way.

N12 Grid. cell = max(1, floor(r / 2 + 0.5)) px (Math.round for r >= 0).
    cols = max(1, ceil(W / cell)), rows = max(1, ceil(H / cell)); node (col, row) sits at
    ((col + 0.5) * cell, (row + 0.5) * cell). A grid of more than 2^24 nodes is refused
    (split the map into chunks). A node is valid when its centre is valid (N9).

N13 Moves and BFS. 4-neighbour moves only. A move between two valid neighbours is open
    exactly when segmentClear (N10, with the thin-gap rule) holds between the two node
    centres; here n = 2, so the move's midpoint, (col + 1) * cell or (row + 1) * cell, is
    sampled too. Moves down (S) and up (N) differ only through one_way. Breadth-first
    search over open moves from the start nodes gives every node's distance in moves
    (-1 when unreachable). grid_bfs also serves passable grids that are not map grids.

N14 Reachability (what map_nav.py check proves).
      Join: a point joins the grid at every valid node within two cells of the cell that
        contains it ((floor(x / cell), floor(y / cell)) clamped to the grid) that it
        reaches by segmentClear; candidates are tried nearest first by squared distance,
        then by row and column. An invalid point joins nothing.
      Starts (spawns, arrival points): every joined node seeds the BFS. A start that is not
        valid, or that joins nothing, is an error.
      Best node: among reached candidates, the fewest moves, then the lowest row, then the
        lowest column.
      Point targets (anchor slots, approach points, interactions without reach): the actor
        must stand there: valid, and joined to a reached node.
      Reach targets (interactions with reach): a reached node centre within reach:
        dx * dx + dy * dy <= reach * reach.
      Exits: trigger distance is 0 inside the closed rect [x, x + w] x [y, y + h] or the
        closed circle, else rect: sqrt(ex * ex + ey * ey) with ex = max(x - px, 0, px - (x + w))
        and ey alike; circle: max(sqrt((px - cx) * (px - cx) + (py - cy) * (py - cy)) - r, 0).
        intent: a reached node at trigger distance <= radius. crossing: a reached node at
        distance 0; else, taking reached nodes within two cells in order of distance (ties
        in row-major order), the first whose straight move to the trigger's closest point is
        clear (segmentClear, and that point valid).

N15 Not modelled here (runtime duties): intent firing (normalised dot(intent,
    travelDirection) > 0.25), latch (default true) and requiresMovement (default true).
    Portal bookkeeping (arrivals outside triggers, reciprocal links) lives in map_nav.py.

Differences from B13's map_nav.py as built: polygon solids are closed (N5, per D1; map_nav
used the even-odd test alone, so a point on a polygon solid's right or bottom edge was
free); footprint basis (N6, D7) and flip_x (N6, D6); and shapes without area block nothing
wherever they come from (N4; map_nav dropped them only from collision.solids and
collision.rects, so a zero-width footprint or tile rect blocked the line it spans).
Everything else is map_nav's behaviour; tests/test_forge_nav.py proves it against map_nav
loaded by path.
