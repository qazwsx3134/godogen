# Parley

![parley-icon](./icon.png)

Parley is an addon for [Godot 4.4+](https://godotengine.org/) that provides a
graph-based dialogue manager for easy writing, testing, and running of Dialogue
Sequences at scale and is designed to be used by game writers and developers
alike.

Write your Dialogue Sequences by defining the graph for your Dialogue Sequence
which are backed by a well-defined Dialogue AST for easy management and
integration within your game.
